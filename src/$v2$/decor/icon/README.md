# UI Icon Element

- **Category:** decoration, wrapper
- **Position:** inline
- **Interactive:** NO

Icon elements, where can be seen everywhere, even in inputs.

## Used [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) Icons

[Has same license agreements and restrictions](https://lucide.dev/license)

## Styling

Has specific styling, such as transparent background (clipped/masked colored) and same colors as fonts.

Due of masking/clipping, instead of `color`, `stroke-color` or `accent-color` was used `background-color`. So, you can also using gradients or pictures, in such icons (in theory).

## Plans?

Thinking about other icon packs support. It's just web-component wrapper.
